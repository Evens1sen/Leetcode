## Algorithm Notes

There are some thoughts and ideas that emerged during my algorithm learning journey, Leetcode practice and real life interviews in some technologies.

Typically, interview problems can be categorized into two types: those that deal with data structures and those that focus on algorithms. Here is a roadmap of these problems.

### Data Structures

#### Array

#### LinkedList

#### Stack

#### Queue

#### String

#### HashMap

#### Tree

#### Heap

#### Graph



### Algorithms

#### Binary Search

#### Sorting

#### Dynamic Programming

#### Greedy

#### Backtracking

#### Divide and Conquer

#### Math and Bit-operations
