package string;

/*
    Description:
    Each time select any character and change it to any other lowercase English letter.
    Use the minimum number of operations so that after all operations,
    some permutation of the string is a palindrome.
    Return the resultant string.
    If there are multiple palindromic permutations, return the alphabetically lowest of them.

    Example:
    s = "aebcd" -> "abbca"

    Solution:
    Scan the string msg to get the frequency map
    Replace odd to even, from most significant to the least significant
    And reconstruct the result string
